// Integration tests for the Clock-NTP library

#[test]
fn test_placeholder() {
    // This test demonstrates that the test infrastructure is set up
    assert!(true);
}

// For proper integration testing, the Clock struct should be tested
// with real NTP servers. However, this requires network access and
// may be flaky in CI environments.
// Additional integration tests can be added here as needed.
