# Example Configuration File for Clock-NTP
# 
# NOTE: Configuration file support is PLANNED but NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
# This file serves as a design document for future configuration file feature.
# Currently, all configuration must be done via command-line arguments.
# See README.md for command-line usage.
#
# Planned for future version: The application will support reading settings
# from a TOML configuration file at ~/.config/clock-ntp/config.toml or
# a path specified via --config flag.
